Macy-s-Test
===========

This is a test application for Macy's ios developer job

Due to the limited time, I was not able to make fancy cell animations

For this project, I used a somple UINavigationController, because this app is has only 1 UIViewController on the screen a time, and it is easy to go back and view other View controllers.
I have 1 singleton class which is the database manager, I turn this class into a singleton because I would need to use it
on most of the views, and it is easy to call the methosd via [ProductDatabase database] anyMethod];

I decided to display my information in a tableviewcell, because tableview is what I am strong at in xcode.
